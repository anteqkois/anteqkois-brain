I used it to react on new insert on the separate service (it can be also achieved using event pattern)\nStorage\nOne of drawback is storage. Day by day it get a much space and from some point server can start thrownig error that there is no space on disk. So we must find sollution to clear periodically old Binary Log entries.\nYou can check logs using SHOW BINARY LOGS\nMySQL statamenet to delete logs\nPURGE BINARY LOGS {\n    TO &#039;log_name&#039;\n  | BEFORE datetime_expr\n}\n\nUsage example\nPURGE BINARY LOGS TO &#039;mysql-bin.010&#039;;\nPURGE BINARY LOGS BEFORE &#039;2019-04-02 22:46:26&#039;;\n\nDonâ€™t delete raw files form using linux commands etc:\n\nPURGE BINARY LOGS TO and PURGE BINARY LOGS BEFORE both fail with an error when binary log files listed in the .index file had been removed from the system by some other means (such as using rm on Linux). (Bug #18199, Bug #18453) To handle such errors, edit the .index file (which is a simple text file) manually to ensure that it lists only the binary log files that are actually present, then run again the PURGE BINARY LOGS statement that failed.\n\nDelete logs\nYou can use set binlog_expire_logs_seconds system veriabel, default is 30 days (2592000).\nWhen thee are deleted:\n\nAfter their expiration period ends, binary log files can be automatically removed. Possible removals happen at startup and when the binary log is flushed\n\nWhen the logs are flushing:\nThe server creates a new file (for binary log) in the series each time any of the following events occurs:\n\nThe server is started or restarted\nThe server flushes the logs.\nThe size of the current log file reaches max_binlog_size.\n\nWhen the logs are flusing:\n\nLog flushing occurs when you issue a FLUSH LOGS statement; execute mysqladmin with a flush-logs or refresh argument; or execute mysqldump with a â€”flush-logs option [â€¦]. In addition, the binary log is flushed when its size reaches the value of the max_binlog_size system variable.\n\nSo change the binlog_expire_logs_seconds and it will do the job. You can check current veriable value using SHOW VARIABLES LIKE &#039;binlog_expire_logs_seconds&#039;. Here is command to change veriable value: SET GLOBAL binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 259200;"},"index":{"title":"Welcome to Antoni's Kois digital garden !","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"For now, the start page is empty ðŸ«£"},"trading/ai-alghoritms/cnn":{"title":"CNNs are excellent for image recognition tasks and can be trained to detect patterns in chart images.","links":[],"tags":["trading","cnn","ai","image-recognition"],"content":"CNNs are excellent for image recognition tasks and can be trained to detect patterns in chart images.\nGithub repository\nCreate CNN with Python\nAdvices and plan to create automated trading"},"trading/pine-script/introduction":{"title":"Use of PineScript from TradingView","links":[],"tags":["trading","pine-script","trading-view"],"content":"Great fast YT tutorial\ncreate plots, strategies, backtesitng\nAlternatives\nThis articel include alternatives to PineScript"},"trading/pine-script/notes":{"title":"Random notes related to PineScript","links":[],"tags":["trading","pine-script","trading-view"],"content":"var keyword\nuse var keyword to define veriable accessed in all bars.\nAccess previus data\nuse index to access previous data, for example close[1] to get previous close"},"trading/strategies/ai-and-supply-demand-zones":{"title":"Strategy which use AI indicator and zones","links":[],"tags":["trading","ai","suppply-demand-zone"],"content":"\nAdd supply and demand zones on the chart.
