# Trade summary
### Why Enter, was a good choise ?
I enter the trade to have a position. It was a bad choose, i choose wrong level to enter a trade, without any strong supply demnand zone, trend lines. Then the trade went into my direct, but sum of, i want enter in wrong place, so the good directon later isn't a good point, it's a bit a lucky.

It was a good position size, i risk maz 5% of capital.
